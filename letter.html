            <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, My Love ♡</h1>
            <p>I may not be good at expressing my feelings using words, but I want you to<br>
                know that you are the most important person that happened in my life.<br>
                Thank you so much sa gift bebe (╥﹏╥) I love it so much, and I love you more <br>than anything in this world.
                I know na medyo late na yung letter ko hehe,<br> I wanted to let you know that you're the only person that gives me so much<br>comfort
                when the world is so mean to me, sa'yo lang ako lagi tatakbo baby.<br>AAAAAA 'di mo lang alam kung gaano kita kamahal, Earl (≧ヮ≦) 💕.

                letter that I can make,<br>and I want to make sure that I can express all of my feelings for you in this letter. 
                <br>I hope you like it, and I hope you can feel all of my love for you<br>through this letter and flower that I made for you.
